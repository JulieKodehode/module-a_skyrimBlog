            Fredas 6th of Second Seed
            <!--(Friday 6th of May)-->
          </h3>

            I saw a dragon. I saw a living dragon. I arrived in Helgen on my way to a certain end,
            <em>being a Stormcloak rebel</em>, fighting for the rights for my kind in Skyrim.
            <em>Skyrim belongs to the Nords. Not the Empire. Not the Altmer</em>. And then out of
            the skies comes the reward from Talos. I ran from the dragon circling above breathing
            fire like it was air, and escaped in the underground tunnels leading out off Helgen with
            a few other who had Talos's blessing this day. The dragon were going to burn us all to
            the ground. The whole town got destroyed, and some lost their lifes in the attack. But I
            made it out alive. Escaping the dragon, I now need to give word to the Jarl of Whiterun
            -
            <b>that dragons have returned.</b>

            Tirdas 28th of Midyear
            <!--(Tuesday 28th of June)-->
          </h3>
          <p>
            I joined Whiteruns forces to attack the dragon, being one of the few that survived the
            attack in Helgen, and help the guards take down the threat. And after, when the dragon
            was down.. I absorbed something. Flowing from the dragon and into me. And then there was
            a loud shout <em>Dovahkiin</em>. Somehow loud enough for everyone to hear, not a blowing
            wind, but a word. A shout. <em>A thu'um</em> only known because of the books no one
            really tought were true anymore, from the great wars against dragons so long ago. A
            fairytale for children. I am being summoned by the Greybeards in the mountain of High
            Hrothgar, and need to find a horse and and ride to Ivarstead right away. And seek the
            high mountain to learn why I was summoned. Learn about my self. Learn about dragons.
            Learn and somehow understand that the fairytale of the dragonborns I heard as a child is
            not a fairytale -<b>but actual true history.</b>

            Middas 13th of Sun's Height
            <!--(Wednesday 13th of July-->
          </h3>
          <p>
            Being trained in archery since my hands could hold the large bow, I learned early that
            food on the table does not magically appear at every meal. Hunting, gathering, fishing,
            harvesting. Sometimes even selling the goods for a few coins, but most off the time
            keeping the goods for food our selfs. My young self could never have imagined that I one
            day would be an adventuring <em>hero</em>. Saving the world from dragons, bandits and
            other creatures spit out from Oblivion. It suddenly became my job to save the world, not
            only fighting for the Stormcloak rebellion to take back Skyrim for the Nords and for
            Talos. But somehow using the bow only meant to bring food on the table, to take down
            numerous off <em>enemies</em>. My newly awoken Dragonborn powers and my skills in
            archery aiding me in
            <b>the fight for Skyrim.</b>
